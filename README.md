*CONTRIBUTE YOUR CODE HERE*

This *testing branch* exists for the 
simple goal of not breaking the actual 
Game. Write your code, see if it works, 
submit a pull request and wait for it to
be reviewed by @Ayden-Herbst or @rohll-off
(Arne Rohloff). It will be merged into
*main* if it gets the green light, or
refused if the code is broken.
